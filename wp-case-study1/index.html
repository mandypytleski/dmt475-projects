			<h1>The Book Shoppe</h1>
			<p>Founded in 1986, Whale and Petunia features an eclectic mix of over 25,000 new and used books, along with unique cards and gifts just for the bibliophile in your life. We specialize in science fiction, fantasy, folklore, literature, regional, and history and also feature the latest bestsellers and quality children’s books. In addition, you will find works from local Wisconsin and Minnesota authors. </p>
				
			<p>At Whale and Petunia, we believe that books are best when shared, so our shoppe offers cozy couches and a warm fireplace, all overlooking Lake Menomin in downtown Menomonie — a perfect spot for your next book club meeting. We invite you to browse our books while enjoying a cup of Brew Devils Coffee, our neighbor that adjoins the book shoppe. We are a group of enthusiastic, well-read booksellers and we look forward to your visit.</p>
